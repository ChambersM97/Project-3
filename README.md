## User Story

As a video game user, I want to be able to look up and save my played games to a list so that I am able to show it to anyone else who plays games, as well as a personal place for nostalgia.

---
## Description
Once a user is registered and verified, our website assigns a pokemon to each individual user, and is then allowed to search a database of games to pick what they want to add to their personal game list. Each game searched contains information such as: game title, platform, year released, and Metacritic review scores.
